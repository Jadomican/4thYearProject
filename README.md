MediApp is a medical assistance app allowing users to keep track of their medicine intake in a simple to use Android application. Data is stored in the AWS Cloud and can be synced to any Android device. Latest work will be available in the [development branch](https://github.com/Jadomican/4thYearProject/tree/development/), with stable versions being subsequently merged into the master.
